## 📌 Overview
The **Interviewer.ai** platform is an AI-driven video interview tool designed to streamline recruitment. This testing process is designed to evaluate:
- **Functionality**: Ensuring core features work correctly.
- **Performance**: Assessing the ability to handle varying loads and stress.
- **Security**: Identifying vulnerabilities to safeguard data and users.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the platform functions across multiple browsers and devices.

## 🧪 Testing Modules

### 1. **Functional Testing**
This module verifies that all core features of the platform are working as intended, such as:
- **Login** functionality
- **Form submissions**
- **User authentication**
- **Data validation** and submission accuracy

### 2. **🎨 UI/UX Testing**
UI/UX testing ensures the visual and interactive aspects of the platform are intuitive and consistent across devices:
- **Layout consistency** across pages
- **Responsiveness** on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Navigation ease** for a seamless user experience

### 3. **⚙️ Load & Stress Testing**
Using **JMeter**, the platform was tested to assess its performance under different conditions:
- **Load Testing**: Simulating 50-100 concurrent users to check if the platform can handle traffic.
- **Stress Testing**: Pushing beyond the limits (up to 1000 concurrent users) to identify potential bottlenecks and vulnerabilities.

### 4. **🌐 Cross-Browser Testing**
We tested the platform on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility:
- **Browsers**: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari
- **Devices**: PC, laptop, tablet, and smartphone

### 5. **🔌 API Testing**
API endpoints were tested using **Postman** to verify functionality:
- **Login API**: Handling valid and invalid credentials
- **Video Upload API**: Ensuring smooth uploads
- **Feedback API**: Confirming that feedback is submitted correctly
- **Profile & Interview Management APIs**: Ensuring correct data retrieval

### 6. **🔐 Security Testing**
Security tests identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited:
- **Header Analysis**: Examining headers for information leakage
- **Cookie Security**: Verifying HttpOnly flags and secure cookie attributes
- **Injection Attacks**: Ensuring protection from SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities
- **Missing Security Headers**: Ensuring headers like **HSTS** and **X-Content-Type-Options** are set properly

## 📊 Test Results

### 🧪 Functional Testing
Most features were validated successfully, including:
- Login functionality
- Form submissions
- Data validation

However, some edge cases revealed minor issues in error handling that need addressing.

### ⚙️ Load & Stress Testing Results
- **Load Test (50 concurrent users)**: The platform performed well with minimal delays.
- **Stress Test (1000 concurrent users)**: Slower response times and occasional timeouts were observed, indicating potential scalability issues under extreme conditions.

### 🌐 Cross-Browser Testing Results
- The platform was **fully functional** across all tested browsers: **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Edge**, and **Safari**.
- It was also **responsive** on various devices, ensuring a consistent experience across **PCs**, **laptops**, **tablets**, and **smartphones**.

### 🔐 Security Testing Results
Several vulnerabilities were detected:
- **Missing HSTS**: The platform is vulnerable to SSL stripping attacks.
- **Missing X-Content-Type-Options**: This could lead to MIME sniffing attacks.
- **PHP Version Exposure**: The server reveals its PHP version in headers, aiding attackers in targeting specific vulnerabilities.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **JMeter**: For Load and Stress Testing
- **Postman**: For API Testing
- **BrowserStack**: For Cross-Browser and Device Testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: For Security Testing

## 🔮 Future Recommendations
- **Implement HSTS** to prevent SSL stripping attacks.
- **Set X-Content-Type-Options header** to prevent MIME sniffing.
- **Increase server capacity** to handle higher traffic during stress testing.
- **Improve cookie security** by setting the HttpOnly flag on critical cookies.
- **Regular security scans** to detect vulnerabilities as the platform evolves.
